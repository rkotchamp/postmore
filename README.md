## Media Handling Implementation

### Blob URL Handling

The application handles media files (images and videos) using JavaScript's Blob URL API. Here are the key implementation details:

#### MediaPlayer Component

We've created a reusable `MediaPlayer` component that properly manages blob URLs:

- Creates blob URLs only once when the component mounts or when the file changes
- Uses proper cleanup on unmount to avoid memory leaks
- Handles both image and video files with appropriate HTML elements
- Provides loading states and error handling
- Ensures blob URLs are only revoked when the component unmounts

#### Preview Implementation

The Preview component displays uploaded media files:

- Uses the `MediaPlayer` component for consistent media handling
- Creates blob URLs from File objects passed through TanStack Query's cache
- Ensures blob URLs are not revoked prematurely
- Adds small delay when creating blob URLs to ensure browser has time to process them

#### Media Upload Flow

1. User drops files in the `MediaPosts` component
2. Files are stored as File objects in TanStack Query's cache
3. Both `MediaPosts` and `Preview` components display the media using the `MediaPlayer` component
4. Blob URLs are properly cleaned up when components unmount

#### Content Security Policy

The application's CSP has been configured to allow blob URLs for media:

```js
// next.config.mjs
media-src 'self' blob:;
```

This ensures browsers can load video and audio content from blob URLs.

### Next Steps

Consider implementing the next-video library for more advanced video handling:

- Enhanced video processing and optimization
- Broader format compatibility
- Better video streaming capabilities
- Built-in analytics
