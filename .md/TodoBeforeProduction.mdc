# Production Readiness Checklist

## Firebase Storage Security

- [x] Update Next.js Content Security Policy to allow connections to Firebase Storage domains
- [x] Configure temporary Firebase Security Rules for development
- [ ] Implement proper Firebase Security Rules with authentication requirements
  ```
  rules_version = '2';
  service firebase.storage {
    match /b/{bucket}/o {
      match /{userId}/{postId}/{fileName} {
        // Allow read for everyone (public media)
        allow read;
        // Allow write only for authenticated users to their own folders
        allow write: if request.auth != null;
        // Add size limits for uploads
        // allow write: if request.auth != null && request.resource.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB limit
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- [ ] Consider enabling Firebase App Check to prevent abuse
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configuration for your storage bucket
- [ ] Create a cleanup process for unused media files

## Authentication & Authorization

- [x] Basic authentication flow implemented with NextAuth.js
- [ ] Implement a robust authentication flow including refresh token management
- [ ] Add proper session timeout and token expiration handling
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Add role-based access control if applicable
- [ ] Set up proper error handling for authentication failures

## API Security & Performance

- [x] Added basic validation for API inputs in the submit endpoint
- [x] Enhanced error handling and logging in API endpoints
- [ ] Implement request throttling to prevent abuse
- [ ] Set up proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Configure appropriate timeouts for external API calls
- [ ] Add monitoring for API endpoint performance and errors
- [ ] Implement caching strategies where appropriate

## Media Processing

- [x] Basic media file uploads to Firebase Storage working
- [x] Media URLs properly passed to API for posting
- [ ] Add media file validation (file type, size, content)
- [ ] Implement image optimization/compression before storage
- [ ] Consider adding video transcoding for wider compatibility
- [ ] Implement a cleanup process for failed uploads
- [ ] Add proper error handling for media processing failures
- [ ] Consider implementing progressive loading for large media files

## BlueSky Specific Optimizations

- [x] Basic BlueSky API integration working with text posts
- [x] Image upload to BlueSky implemented with alt text support
- [x] Video handling via link insertion in post text
- [ ] Add better error handling for BlueSky API rate limits
- [ ] Implement token refresh for long-lived sessions
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient BlueSky API errors
- [ ] Consider implementing a queue for BlueSky posts during API outages
- [ ] Monitor and log BlueSky API usage and errors

## Error Handling & Logging

- [x] Added detailed logging in server API routes
- [x] Enhanced error handling in platform service implementations
- [x] Improved client-side error feedback
- [ ] Implement structured logging throughout the application
- [ ] Set up centralized error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Add proper user feedback for errors (friendly error messages)
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting for critical errors
- [ ] Add detailed logging for debugging production issues

## Environment Setup

- [x] Basic Firebase configuration using environment variables
- [ ] Use separate Firebase projects for dev/staging/production
- [ ] Set up proper environment variables for each environment
- [ ] Review and lock down all environment secrets
- [ ] Consider using Firebase environments feature

## Performance Optimizations

- [x] Basic media upload optimization implemented
- [ ] Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize media loading and display
- [ ] Add proper caching strategies (SWR, React Query)
- [ ] Implement service worker for offline capability
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with proper tree shaking
- [ ] Consider implementing server-side rendering for key pages

## Testing

- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Implement integration tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for key features
- [ ] Set up testing for edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Implement performance testing for media uploads/downloads

## Deployment & CI/CD

- [ ] Set up proper CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Implement blue/green deployments or canary releases
- [ ] Add automated rollback capability for failed deployments
- [ ] Implement proper environment promotion workflow
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for deployment failures

## Documentation

- [ ] Document API endpoints and their usage
- [ ] Create user documentation for key features
- [ ] Document environment setup and deployment process
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
- [ ] Document security considerations and best practices

## Legal & Compliance

- [ ] Ensure proper Terms of Service are in place
- [ ] Implement and document privacy policy
- [ ] Consider data retention policies for user content
- [ ] Review platform-specific terms and ensure compliance
- [ ] Implement data export/deletion capabilities for user data

## Monitoring & Analytics

- [ ] Set up application performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement user analytics for feature usage
- [ ] Add monitoring for external API dependencies
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical issues
- [ ] Implement logging for security and audit purposes

## Accessibility

- [ ] Ensure application meets WCAG guidelines
- [ ] Add proper aria labels and roles
- [ ] Test with screen readers and accessibility tools
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] Ensure proper color contrast and text sizing

## Current Bug Investigation

- [x] Debug the current 500 error in the API endpoint:
  1. [x] Add detailed logging in the server API route
  2. [x] Check for validation issues with the post data
  3. [x] Verify MongoDB connection and schema validation
  4. [x] Inspect BlueSky service implementation for edge cases
  5. [x] Verify proper error handling in the API Manager

- [ ] Further investigation needed for 500 error:
  1. [ ] Check if BlueSky token authentication is still valid
  2. [ ] Verify media URLs are accessible from the server
  3. [ ] Test BlueSky posting with minimal content first (text only)
  4. [ ] Add explicit validation for required BlueSky API parameters
  5. [ ] Look for timing/race conditions in async promises
