# Production Readiness Checklist

## Firebase Storage Security

- [ ] Implement proper Firebase Security Rules with authentication requirements
  ```
  rules_version = '2';
  service firebase.storage {
    match /b/{bucket}/o {
      match /{userId}/{postId}/{fileName} {
        // Allow read for everyone (public media)
        allow read;
        // Allow write only for authenticated users to their own folders
        allow write: if request.auth != null;
        // Add size limits for uploads
        // allow write: if request.auth != null && request.resource.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB limit
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- [ ] Consider enabling Firebase App Check to prevent abuse
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configuration for your storage bucket
- [ ] Create a cleanup process for unused media files

## Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] Implement a robust authentication flow including refresh token management
- [ ] Add proper session timeout and token expiration handling
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Add role-based access control if applicable
- [ ] Set up proper error handling for authentication failures

## API Security & Performance

- [ ] Add proper validation for all API inputs
- [ ] Implement request throttling to prevent abuse
- [ ] Set up proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Configure appropriate timeouts for external API calls
- [ ] Add monitoring for API endpoint performance and errors
- [ ] Implement caching strategies where appropriate

## Media Processing

- [ ] Add media file validation (file type, size, content)
- [ ] Implement image optimization/compression before storage
- [ ] Consider adding video transcoding for wider compatibility
- [ ] Implement a cleanup process for failed uploads
- [ ] Add proper error handling for media processing failures
- [ ] Consider implementing progressive loading for large media files

## BlueSky Specific Optimizations

- [ ] Add better error handling for BlueSky API rate limits
- [ ] Implement token refresh for long-lived sessions
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient BlueSky API errors
- [ ] Consider implementing a queue for BlueSky posts during API outages
- [ ] Monitor and log BlueSky API usage and errors

## Error Handling & Logging

- [ ] Implement structured logging throughout the application
- [ ] Set up centralized error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Add proper user feedback for errors (friendly error messages)
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting for critical errors
- [ ] Add detailed logging for debugging production issues

## Environment Setup

- [ ] Use separate Firebase projects for dev/staging/production
- [ ] Set up proper environment variables for each environment
- [ ] Review and lock down all environment secrets
- [ ] Consider using Firebase environments feature

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize media loading and display
- [ ] Add proper caching strategies (SWR, React Query)
- [ ] Implement service worker for offline capability
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with proper tree shaking
- [ ] Consider implementing server-side rendering for key pages

## Testing

- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Implement integration tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for key features
- [ ] Set up testing for edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Implement performance testing for media uploads/downloads

## Deployment & CI/CD

- [ ] Set up proper CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Implement blue/green deployments or canary releases
- [ ] Add automated rollback capability for failed deployments
- [ ] Implement proper environment promotion workflow
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for deployment failures

## Documentation

- [ ] Document API endpoints and their usage
- [ ] Create user documentation for key features
- [ ] Document environment setup and deployment process
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
- [ ] Document security considerations and best practices

## Legal & Compliance

- [ ] Ensure proper Terms of Service are in place
- [ ] Implement and document privacy policy
- [ ] Consider data retention policies for user content
- [ ] Review platform-specific terms and ensure compliance
- [ ] Implement data export/deletion capabilities for user data

## Monitoring & Analytics

- [ ] Set up application performance monitoring
- [ ] Implement user analytics for feature usage
- [ ] Add monitoring for external API dependencies
- [ ] Set up alerting for critical issues
- [ ] Implement logging for security and audit purposes

## Accessibility

- [ ] Ensure application meets WCAG guidelines
- [ ] Add proper aria labels and roles
- [ ] Test with screen readers and accessibility tools
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] Ensure proper color contrast and text sizing

## Current Bug Investigation

- [ ] Debug the current 500 error in the API endpoint:
  1. Add detailed logging in the server API route
  2. Check for validation issues with the post data
  3. Verify MongoDB connection and schema validation
  4. Inspect BlueSky service implementation for edge cases
  5. Verify proper error handling in the API Manager
