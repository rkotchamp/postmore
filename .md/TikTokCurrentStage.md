# TikTok Integration - Current State

## Overview

We've successfully implemented the TikTok OAuth flow and are receiving valid tokens from the TikTok API. After several days of troubleshooting, we identified and fixed multiple issues with the integration.

## What's Working

- ✅ OAuth authorization flow with TikTok
- ✅ Receiving the authorization code from TikTok
- ✅ Exchanging the code for valid access and refresh tokens
- ✅ Receiving proper scopes: user.info.basic, video.list, video.publish

## Key Fixes Made

1. **Removed PKCE Implementation**

   - PKCE is only required for mobile and desktop apps, not web applications
   - Removed code_verifier and code_challenge which were causing issues

2. **Fixed Authorization URL**

   - Using the correct production endpoint: `https://www.tiktok.com/v2/auth/authorize/`
   - Properly encoding all URL parameters

3. **Simplified Authentication Flow**

   - Created a more straightforward implementation following TikTok's documentation
   - Added better error handling and logging

4. **Implemented Debug Mode**
   - Created a simplified callback handler that focuses on the token exchange
   - Added detailed logging of the TikTok API responses

## Current Server Response

We're now receiving a valid token response from TikTok:

```json
{
  "access_token": "act.ryNumYjt0ylWzJ0KZICpqeWvVvTlS5fket9b8V8p1X7UrcdgQhjlEnXUX34y!6125.e1",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "open_id": "-0008lVNLGQuBTXMxrbzGTJlFopBHifNpLU4",
  "refresh_expires_in": 31536000,
  "refresh_token": "rft.8K00PJTsPF8bnPbe6uArW8dGyb6Sz9j5u34fm07uTp3P8cDKCPSGCoR5RZhL!6085.e1",
  "scope": "user.info.basic,video.list,video.publish",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Re-enable Full Functionality**

   - Re-implement user info fetching using the token
   - Re-enable database storage of the social account
   - Link the social account to the user correctly

2. **Implement TikTok API Features**

   - Display User Profile: Call `/v2/user/info/` to get user details
   - Display User Videos: Call `/v2/video/list/` to get user's videos
   - Implement video selection interface (if needed)
     -Implement video Publish

3. **Token Management**

   - Implement token refresh mechanism using the refresh_token
   - Add proper error handling for expired tokens
   - Store tokens securely in the database

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test all flows thoroughly
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Verify token refresh works correctly

## Configuration Settings

- Ensure these environment variables are set correctly:
  - `TIKTOK_CLIENT_ID` (TikTok app's client key)
  - `TIKTOK_CLIENT_SECRET` (TikTok app's client secret)
  - `TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI` (Must match exactly what's registered in TikTok developer portal)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TIKTOK_CLIENT_ID` (Same as TIKTOK_CLIENT_ID, for frontend)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI` (Same as TIKTOK_REDIRECT_URI, for frontend)

## Critical Files

- `app/api/auth/callback/tiktok/route.js` - Handles OAuth callback and token exchange
- `app/authenticate/page.jsx` - Initiates the TikTok authentication flow

## Troubleshooting Notes

- If issues occur again, check that the redirect URI in the TikTok Developer Portal exactly matches what's in your environment variables
- Ensure TikTok app has been approved for the scopes being requested
- The TikTok API can be picky about parameter encoding, ensure proper URL encoding is used
- Do not use PKCE for web applications - it's only for mobile/desktop
