# Bluesky Integration for PostMore

This document provides an overview of the Bluesky integration we've implemented for PostMore.

## Features Implemented

1. **Authentication and Token Management**

   - Secure token storage in MongoDB
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Session resumption using stored tokens

2. **Post Publishing**

   - Text-only posts with proper caption handling
   - Media posts with image uploads (up to 4 images)
   - Support for both single captions and account-specific captions

3. **Testing Tools**
   - Dedicated test API endpoint (`/api/test/bluesky`)
   - Test UI page (`/dashboard/test-bluesky`)
   - Detailed logging for debugging

## Implementation Details

### API Structure

- `blueSkyService.js`: Core service implementing Bluesky API interactions
- `apiManager.js`: Central manager for routing requests to platform-specific services
- `posts/submit/route.js`: Main API endpoint for post submission
- `test/bluesky/route.js`: Test API endpoint for quick testing
- `accounts/route.js`: Endpoint for retrieving user's Bluesky accounts

### Posting Flow

1. User selects content and Bluesky accounts
2. Frontend constructs post data with proper caption handling
3. API receives the request and validates required fields
4. API Manager passes normalized data to the Bluesky service
5. Bluesky service authenticates with stored tokens
6. For media posts, files are retrieved and uploaded to Bluesky
7. Post is published and the result is returned

### Authentication Flow

1. Account data is stored in MongoDB with access and refresh tokens
2. When posting, the service attempts to resume the session with stored tokens
3. If the token is expired, the refresh token is used to get a new access token
4. The updated tokens are stored back in the database
5. Session is resumed with the new tokens

## Error Handling

- Detailed error messages for authentication failures
- Fallback mechanisms for media upload failures
- Comprehensive logging throughout the process
- User-friendly error notifications

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Bluesky Features**

   - Support for mentions and links
   - Rich text formatting
   - Thread creation

2. **Scheduling System**
   - Implement BullMQ for queuing posts
   - Reliable scheduling with retries
   - Status tracking for scheduled posts

## Testing

To test the Bluesky integration:

1. Go to `/dashboard/test-bluesky` in the application
2. Select a Bluesky account from the dropdown
3. Enter text for your post
4. Click "Post to Bluesky" button
5. Check the result and any error messages
