## PostMore Development: Progress, Hurdles, and Next Steps

This document summarizes the development progress for the PostMore application, current challenges, and a proposed way forward.

### I. Milestones Achieved

We have successfully laid a significant foundation for the PostMore application, encompassing backend services, data management, and frontend integration:

1.  **MongoDB Data Modeling (`PostSchema.js`):**
    *   Established a comprehensive Mongoose schema to store post details, including `contentType`, textual content, media references (with a nested `MediaSchema`), associated accounts (`AccountSchema`), multi-faceted captions (`CaptionsSchema`), scheduling information (`ScheduleSchema`), post status, and platform-specific results (`ResultSchema`).
    *   Integrated helper methods like `findByUserId` and `findScheduled` for efficient data retrieval.

2.  **Firebase Storage Integration (`firebase-config.js`, `firebase.js`):**
    *   Modularized Firebase setup by separating configuration from implementation logic.
    *   Securely configured Firebase using environment variables.
    *   Developed robust utilities for file operations:
        *   Uploads (single `uploadFile`, multiple `uploadMultipleFiles`) and deletions.
        *   Specialized uploads for post media (`uploadPostMedia`) and profile pictures (`uploadProfilePicture`).
        *   Ensured unique filenames using UUIDs.
        *   Structured file organization within Firebase Storage (e.g., `/posts/{postId}/{fileType}/`, `/profiles/{userId}/`).

3.  **Custom React Hooks (`useFirebaseStorage.js`, `useMediaMutations.js`):**
    *   `useFirebaseStorage`: A general-purpose hook for interacting with Firebase Storage, providing UI state for uploads (`isUploading`, `uploadProgress`) and error handling.
    *   `useMediaMutations`: A specialized hook tailored for post submissions. It leverages `useFirebaseStorage` to manage media uploads and prepares media data in the format required by the backend API.

4.  **Core API Endpoint (`app/api/posts/submit/route.js`):**
    *   Implemented a central `POST` API route to handle both immediate and scheduled post submissions.
    *   Features include: user authentication, request parsing and validation, MongoDB document creation and updates, and robust error handling.
    *   Dynamically ensures database connectivity.
    *   Delegates posting and scheduling logic to the `apiManager`.
    *   Manages caption selection through `getCaptionForPlatform`.

5.  **Service Orchestration (`apiManager.js`):**
    *   Designed an `apiManager` to act as a facade, routing requests to appropriate platform-specific services.
    *   Currently integrates a functional `blueSkyService.js` and includes placeholder/simulation logic for Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
    *   Standardizes service calls through `postToPlatform`, `postToMultiplePlatforms`, and `schedulePost` (simulated).
    *   Contains `getCaptionForPlatform` logic to select the correct caption based on `captions.mode` and `captions.multipleCaptions`.

6.  **Bluesky Platform Integration (`blueSkyService.js`):**
    *   Developed a service to post content to Bluesky using the `@atproto/api` SDK.
    *   Handles Bluesky authentication (user handle and app password).
    *   Correctly determines post text based on `postData.contentType` and the detailed captioning logic (single vs. multiple, account-specific).
    *   Placeholder for media file embedding exists for future implementation.

7.  **Dashboard User Interface (`dashboard-content.jsx`):**
    *   Successfully integrated the frontend dashboard with the `/api/posts/submit` API endpoint via `fetch`.
    *   Manages form state by aggregating data from `useUIStateStore` (for post type, text content) and `usePostStore` (for accounts, captions, scheduling).
    *   Constructs the `submissionData` payload, ensuring consistent property names (`text`, `type`, `at`, `multipleCaptions`) as per backend expectations.
    *   Provides user feedback through loading states (`isSubmitting`) and `sonner` toast notifications for API call success or failure.
    *   Addressed and resolved initial toast import issues.
    *   Implements state reset mechanisms post-submission.

8.  **Data Consistency Across Layers:**
    *   Addressed and resolved inconsistencies in property naming (e.g., `textPostOnlyContent` vs. `text`, `scheduledType` vs. `type`, `captions.platforms` vs. `captions.multipleCaptions`) ensuring smooth data flow from frontend stores through the API to backend services.

### II. Current Challenges & Roadblocks

Despite significant progress, we are encountering a few key issues:

1.  **Persistent 500 API Error (Previously):**
    *   We faced a recurring 500 HTTP error during post submissions. This was primarily attributed to:
        *   Mismatches in data property names between the frontend payload and backend expectations.
        *   Inconsistent handling of caption structures (specifically `platforms` vs. `multipleCaptions`).
        *   Initial concerns regarding Mongoose model registration and database connection stability within the serverless API route environment.
    *   *Status: Believed to be largely resolved with recent property name alignment and DB connection checks, but requires thorough verification.*

2.  **Incomplete Bluesky Media Functionality:**
    *   The `blueSkyService.js` currently includes only placeholder logic for media uploads. Actual embedding of images/videos using `agent.uploadBlob` is not yet implemented.

3.  **Placeholder Platform Services:**
    *   The `apiManager.js` relies on simulated services for Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Full implementations for these platforms are pending.

4.  **Simulated Scheduling System:**
    *   The `schedulePost` function within `apiManager.js` is a placeholder. A robust job queue system (e.g., BullMQ with Redis) needs to be integrated for reliable scheduled posting.

### III. Strategic Path Forward

To address the current challenges and continue development, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Rigorous Testing & 500 Error Verification:**
    *   Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of the post submission flow, with a primary focus on Bluesky.
    *   Closely monitor server-side logs (Next.js console, any specific API logs) to confirm the 500 error is fully resolved. If it persists, dive deeper into the API route's execution path and database interactions.

2.  **Implement Bluesky Media Uploads:**
    *   Prioritize the implementation of media (image/video) uploading and embedding within `blueSkyService.js` using the `agent.uploadBlob` method and appropriate embed types (e.g., `app.bsky.embed.images`).
    *   Ensure that media file data (Firebase URLs or fetched blobs) is correctly passed and processed by the service.

3.  **Develop Remaining Platform Services:**
    *   Sequentially implement the `post` methods (including media handling) for other targeted social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.).
    *   Create dedicated service files for each, following the pattern of `blueSkyService.js`, and integrate them into the `platformServices` registry in `apiManager.js`.

4.  **Integrate a Job Queue for Scheduling:**
    *   Select and implement a job queue solution (BullMQ with Redis is a common choice in Node.js environments).
    *   Refactor `apiManager.schedulePost` to create and add jobs to this queue.
    *   Develop worker processes that listen to the queue, pick up scheduled jobs, and execute `apiManager.postToPlatform` at the designated time.

5.  **Enhance Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Implement more granular and context-specific error handling at each layer (frontend, API, services).
    *   Expand server-side logging to provide clearer insights into request processing and potential failure points.

6.  **Refine User Interface and Experience (UI/UX):**
    *   Implement actual progress indicators for file uploads in `useFirebaseStorage` and propagate this to the UI.
    *   Improve visual feedback for loading states and background operations.

7.  **Comprehensive Testing Strategy:**
    *   Develop unit tests for individual functions and services.
    *   Create integration tests for API endpoints and critical user flows.

By systematically addressing these points, we can move towards a fully functional and robust PostMore application.
